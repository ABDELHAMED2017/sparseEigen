This is the first release in CRAN (package also available in GitHub).

---

## Test environments
* OS X, R 3.4.2
* Windows at http://win-builder.r-project.org/win-builder

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs.

There were two WARNINGs:
* about the possibility of compressing the pdf of the vignette. However, if I do the second figure in the pdf becomes really low quality, which is unacceptable
* warns about package vignette without the corresponding pdf/html, but the vignette has both pdf and html.

## Reverse dependencies

There are currently no reverse dependencies for this package.
